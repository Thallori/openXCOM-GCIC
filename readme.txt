Inspiration comes from many sources, too many to list. Ranging from decades old fan fiction to scientific journals. However, the ideas taken from the OpenXCom community are listed here.

X-Com Files/FMP
 Early game of sending a tiny number of soldiers to kill a tiny number of weak enemies. The progression of turning into a global agency from humble beginnings. Aliens not being a threat until later. Characters in research unlocks. Limiting equipment loadouts based on mission types. Commendations and transformations as a major training method. AIs as soldiers. Aliens as soldiers. Psionic shields. Facility based progression. Manufacturing size zero. Static defenses for base defense missions. Early game (non-OP) psionics. Shields. Power bonuses. Sanity. The moon.

40k
 Spawning 'disposable' allies at mission start. Recoil/strength requirements. The power of scripting in general. Redoing the geoscape to tell a completely different story. Outpost mechanics and base defense missions. Facility art direction.

X-Piratez
 Item and facility based income/storage mechanics. Balancing the metaprogression around money and number of scientists. Purchasing based progression. Different soldier types. Negative score missions. Enviromental effects. Energy management. Bounties. Freshness. Hacking. Space.

Reaver's Harmony
 Geoscape ship mechanics, ship upgrades being compatible with all weapon slots. Salvaging equipment into components.

From the Ashes
 Soldier specialization. Reminding me how much more fun base defense missions are when you don't build defensively.

From the Apocalypse
 Aircars. Happy gumball techno future. 

Xeno Operations
 Highlighted choice for earning money from engineering projects.

NuclearWorld
 TU damage instead of CQC to make melee options safer on aggression without making them overpowered on the defensive.
